## Youtube Video Downloader v2

This project aims to develop a system that automatically sends email notifications when selected YouTube channels upload a new video or go live, and downloads the recorded video after the live session ends. The system uses the **YouTube Data API** to monitor channel statuses and implements core functionalities using **Python**. Data is managed via an **SQLite** database.

### Why an OOP version?

While the functional version works fine, it can become harder to maintain as the project grows.  
Refactoring it into an object-oriented structure helps demonstrate:

- Code organization
- Separation of concerns
- Reusability
- Scalability

Itâ€™s also a great exercise to show flexibility in thinking as a developer.
